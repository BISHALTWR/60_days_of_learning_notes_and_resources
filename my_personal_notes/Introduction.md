# Artificial Intelligence

> AI is simulation of human intelligence in machines.

## Levels of AI:
- ANI : weak AI, limited or single task
- AGI : like human, any type of task
- ASI : better than human intelligence

## Machine Learning

> Increase in performance with increase in data and time without explicit programming.

- Traditional algorithms give result using input and rules. ML gives rules based on input and output.

### Components:

- Data : large amount of clean data
- Model : choosing appropriate model for task
- Learning : or training to improve performance
- Application

### Types:

- Supervised: labelled data as input
    - classification
- Unsupervised: Data with no label
    - clustering
- Reinforced learning: Learns on its own to maximize reward

## Deep Learning

> Part of Machine learning that uses human brain's neuron like approach
