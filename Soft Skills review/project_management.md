# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### What is SDLC?

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process to approach software development from idea to end of life.

### Phases of SDLC

1. **Planning**: Define the project scope, objectives, and feasibility. Develop a project plan that outlines the resources, timeline, and budget.
2. **Requirements Analysis**: Gather and analyze the functional and non-functional requirements of the software from stakeholders.
3. **Design**: Create the architecture and design of the software, including data models, interface designs, and system components.
4. **Development**: Write and compile the code to build the software application. This phase involves actual coding based on the design documents.
5. **Testing**: Validate the software to ensure it meets the required specifications. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
6. **Deployment**: Release the software to the production environment where it will be used by end-users. This phase may include additional testing and user training.
7. **Maintenance**: Provide ongoing support, fix bugs, and implement enhancements or updates to the software.

### Some Models of SDLC

1. **Waterfall Model**: A linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
2. **Agile Model**: An iterative and incremental approach that allows for flexible and rapid delivery of software components.

### Importance of SDLC

- **Quality Assurance**
- **Project Management**
- **Risk Management**
- **Cost Management**
- **Documentation**

> By leveraging project management tools, teams can streamline their workflow, improve efficiency, and deliver high-quality software that meets user expectations.
