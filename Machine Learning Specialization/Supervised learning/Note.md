# Machine Learning

> Getting computers to learn without explicit programming.

## Supervised Learning

> They learn X -> Y mappings. i.e. Predicts output label for input

> * Try housing price prediction using regression. *

- Regression problem: Infinitely many possible outputs.
- Classification problem: Finite number of output(classes or categories).

- These sounds fun. 
    - Train a ML model to predict sum of two numbers.
    - Classification odd or even.

## Unsupervised Learning

> There isn't a output label. Find something interesting in unlabeled data. (For eg. Clustering)

- Think of google news as example
- Anomaly detection
- Dimenesionality reduction
